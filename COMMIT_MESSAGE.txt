## Changes

### Fixed

- Dynamic URL generation for all Telegram inline keyboards

### Improved
- Telegram notification messages now include direct links to orders
- Better user experience with working "View Order" and "My Orders" buttons
- Environment-aware URL generation (dev/production)

### Details
- Updated 3 inline keyboard definitions in telegram.ts:
  1. New order notification → links to specific order
  2. Order picked notification → links to "my orders" tab
  3. Order status update notification → links to "my orders" tab
- All URLs now use `${baseUrl}/courier/dashboard?order=${id}` format
- Fallback to localhost:3000 for development
